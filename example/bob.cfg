# Example bob configuration file.
#
# Used by 'bob-config' to establish a build directory, from which a 'bob'
# command will build your project.
#
# This file should be located at the top level of a repository, below which
# are source directories.
#
# Before running bob-config, you need to:
# * Check out the project's source repository(s).
# * Ensure that all the project's external dependencies are available,
#   either in standard system locations or in local project-specific
#   locations.
# Bob does not verify external dependencies.
#
# If your project is built for a number of target architectures, use
# one config file for each architecture, and specify which one on the bob-config
# command-line.

# Top-level syntax is a series of sections, each starting with a line:
# [section-name]
#
# Comment lines begin with '#'.
#
# The syntax for each section is section-specific, and described in each
# section.

[defines]

# Define variables.
#
# Any relative paths provided in variable definitions are relative to
# the directory this file is in, which is also the working directory
# of bob-config.
#
# A variable definition is: name = text
#
# Variables required by bob are:
#
#   PROJECT  - Path to directory containing the project's top-level Bobfile.
#   REPOS    - Paths to other repos, below which are source directories that
#              are available to build as part of this project.
#   SYS_INC  - Non-standard paths searched for system includes.
#   SYS_LIB  - Non-standard paths searched for system libraries.
#   SYS_PATH - Non-standard paths searched for system utilities.
#   SYS_IMP  - Non-standard paths searched for D imports.
#   D_EXTERN - Top-level D packages that are external to the project.
#
# Also required are build commands.
#
# Build-command variables are used by bob to create the built files specified
# in the project's Bobfile(s). They are of the form:
#     <input-ext> <built-ext>(s) = command
# Reserved extensions with special meaning are:
#     .obj  -> object file
#     .slib -> static library
#     .dlib -> dynamic library
#     .exe  -> executable
# The extensions actually used vary with platform.
# Libraries and executables are actually built from object files, but the names
# of the commands need to specify the extension of the source file the object
# file was generated from.
#
# Reserved variables defined by bob from information in Bobfiles
# and can be used in variable defintions are:
#
#   INPUT    - Paths of the input file(s) relative to the build dir.
#   BUILT    - Paths of the resultant built file(s) relative to the build dir.
#   PROJ_IMP - Project import paths.
#   PROJ_INC - Project include paths.
#   PROJ_LIB - Project library paths.
#   LIBS     - Required libraries.
#
# ${} expands a variable, cross-multiplying it with whatever it is adjacent to.
# eg, if HEADERS = one two three, then -I${HEADERS} becomes -Ione -Itwo -Ithree.   
# If the variable is empty, the cross-multiplication is also empty.
# Variable expansion occurs just before a build command is issued.
