High priority wish-list
-----------------------

* Finish Windows port.


Lower priority wish-list
------------------------

* Conditional Bubfile statements.

* Add a mechanism to scrape the names of additional output filenames from
  a source file using (say) a regex. Intention is to allow things like
  plantuml diagram text to be embedded inside an rst file.

* Generation of documentation from the code.

* Support code coverage analysis for test-exe.

* Improve correctness of scanning for imports and includes.

* Improve parsing of config files to allow more flexible build commands.

* Extend bub-config's scope to assist with satisfying external dependencies.
