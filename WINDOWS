Bub was developed under Linux, and the Windows port is a work in progress.

Known issues:

Only tested with the dmd compiler and the g++ compiler packaged with Dev-Cpp.

bub-config uses symbolic links in the src subdirectory to point to the
actual locations of the top-level packages. This means that when running
bub-config, you have to have Vista or better, and be running a shell or batch
file as administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on the command-prompt
or batch file icons. Unfortunately when doing so, you can't see any network
drives (such as a virtual machine shared folder), so you may need to locate
your source onto a local windows drive.
