Bub is a build tool written in D which supports building of large C/C++/D
projects.

Bub is written and maintained by Graham St Jack (Graham.StJack@internode.on.net).

Some of bub's features that are useful on large projects are:

* Built files are located outside the source directory.

* Very simple configuration files.

* Enforcement of dependency control, with prevention of circularities between
  modules and directories.

* Automatic deduction of which project libraries to link with.

* Automatic execution and evaluation of tests.

* Built files are not produced until all the files that they might depend on
  are up to date.


Bub is currently primarily developed and tested on Linux, but has also been partly
tested on Windows.  It should work on OS-X.


To build on Linux, run 'make' in this directory.

To build on Windows, run build_with_dmd.bat in this directory. Note that the
Windows port is incomplete.
