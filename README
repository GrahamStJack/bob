Bub is a build tool written in D which supports building of large C/C++/D
projects.

Bub is written and maintained by Graham St Jack (Graham.StJack@internode.on.net).

Some of bub's features that are useful on large projects are:

* Built files are located outside the source directory.

* Very simple configuration files.

* Enforcement of dependency control, with prevention of circularities between
  modules and directories.

* Automatic deduction of which project libraries to link with.

* Automatic execution and evaluation of tests.

* Generated files are not scanned for imports/includes until after they are up to date.


Bub is currently primarily developed and tested on Linux, but has also been tested on Windows.
It should work on OS-X.
