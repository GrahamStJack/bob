Bob is a build tool written in D which supports building of large C/C++/D
projects.

Bob is written and maintained by Graham St Jack (Graham.StJack@internode.on.net).

Some of bob's features that are useful on large projects are:

* Built files are located outside the source directory.

* Very simple configuration files.

* Enforcement of dependency control, with prevention of circularities between
  modules and packages (directories).

* Automatic deduction of which project libraries to link with.

* Automatic execution and evaluation of tests.

* Generated files are not scanned for imports/includes until after they are up to date.


While Bob already works, it is still a bit raw and unready for the real world.
For example, it only works on Linux and only supports gcc and dmd compilers.

It has been placed on Git Hub as a starting point on its transformation into an
open-source package.


The current todo list is:

* Change the rules to be configurable via a text configuration file, rather
  than reqiring users to modify bob's source code.

* Provide built-in configuration files for dmd, gdc, gcc and g++.  

* Change configure_functions into a configurable configure utility, so that
  users don't need to write their own configure programs.

* Improve documentation.

* Provide examples.

* Port to Windows and OS-X.
